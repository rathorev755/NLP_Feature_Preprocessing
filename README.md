# NLP_Feature_Preprocessing
CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer, TfIdfVectorizer

This notebook is divided into two sections:

First, we'll find out what is necessary to build an NLP system that can turn a body of text into a numerical array of features by manually calculating frequencies and building out TF-IDF.
Next, we'll show how to perform these steps using scikit-learn tools.
